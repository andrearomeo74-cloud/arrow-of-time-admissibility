# The Arrow of Time as an Admissibility Boundary
## Scope and Intent

This repository explores the arrow of time not as a fundamental dynamical law,
but as an emergent boundary arising from admissibility and closure constraints.

Rather than asking why physical processes evolve from past to future,
the focus here is on a different question:

**What conditions allow a direction of time to remain stable and distinguishable at all?**

The central hypothesis is that temporal irreversibility does not originate
from dynamics alone (e.g. entropy production),
but from asymmetries in what can close, persist, and remain admissible
across scales.

In this view, the arrow of time is treated as a boundary phenomenon:
a directional bias that appears when systems transition from reversible
descriptions to regimes where closure becomes necessary.

## Reversibility, Irreversibility, and Boundary Formation

At the level of fundamental physical laws, most known dynamics are time-reversible.
Classical mechanics, electromagnetism, and even quantum evolution preserve symmetry
under time reversal.

Yet at macroscopic scales, systems exhibit a clear temporal direction:
processes unfold, decay occurs, memories accumulate, and histories cannot be undone.

This apparent contradiction suggests that irreversibility does not emerge
from the laws themselves, but from the conditions under which descriptions
remain stable.

The transition from reversible to irreversible behavior is proposed here
to coincide with the emergence of closure constraints:
situations in which not all microstates remain admissible or reconstructible.

When closure becomes necessary—due to complexity, information loss, or scale—
temporal symmetry breaks, and a directional arrow becomes observable.

Irreversibility, in this sense, is not imposed by dynamics,
but selected by admissibility.

## Observation, Measurement, and Closure

In quantum theory, the measurement problem highlights a tension between
continuous, unitary evolution and discrete, irreversible outcomes.
While the formalism allows superpositions, observations yield definite results.

Rather than treating measurement as a special physical process,
this framework interprets it as a boundary event:
the point at which open descriptions give way to closed ones.

Measurement coincides with the enforcement of admissibility.
Only those states that remain stable under closure constraints
can persist as observable outcomes.

In this view, the observer is not an external entity imposing collapse,
but a condition under which closure becomes necessary.
Observation is not the cause of irreversibility,
but the moment at which irreversibility becomes unavoidable.

What is measured is not selected arbitrarily;
it is what can remain.

## Arrow of Time and Classical Emergence

The arrow of time is often treated as an independent problem,
introduced through entropy increase, cosmological initial conditions,
or coarse-graining assumptions.

Within this framework, the arrow of time emerges naturally
as a consequence of closure.

Reversible dynamics can persist only while descriptions remain open.
Once admissibility constraints are enforced,
only irreversible transitions can stabilize outcomes.

Classical behavior is not a separate regime imposed on quantum systems.
It is the limit in which closure occurs rapidly and redundantly,
suppressing interference and enforcing persistent structure.

The classical world appears not because quantum mechanics fails,
but because closure succeeds.

Time acquires direction at the moment when alternatives cease to remain viable.
What survives defines both history and order.

## Synthesis

The quantum measurement problem, the emergence of classicality,
and the arrow of time are not separate mysteries.

They arise from a single constraint:
only descriptions that close can persist.

Measurement is the moment when admissibility is enforced.
Classical structure is what remains after closure.
Time acquires direction when alternatives are no longer viable.

Nothing collapses arbitrarily.
Nothing requires an external observer.

What stabilizes does so because it can.
