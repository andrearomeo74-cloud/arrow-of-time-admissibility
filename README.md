# The Arrow of Time as an Admissibility Boundary
## Scope and Intent

This repository explores the arrow of time not as a fundamental dynamical law,
but as an emergent boundary arising from admissibility and closure constraints.

Rather than asking why physical processes evolve from past to future,
the focus here is on a different question:

**What conditions allow a direction of time to remain stable and distinguishable at all?**

The central hypothesis is that temporal irreversibility does not originate
from dynamics alone (e.g. entropy production),
but from asymmetries in what can close, persist, and remain admissible
across scales.

In this view, the arrow of time is treated as a boundary phenomenon:
a directional bias that appears when systems transition from reversible
descriptions to regimes where closure becomes necessary.
