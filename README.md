# The Arrow of Time as an Admissibility Boundary
## Scope and Intent

This repository explores the arrow of time not as a fundamental dynamical law,
but as an emergent boundary arising from admissibility and closure constraints.

Rather than asking why physical processes evolve from past to future,
the focus here is on a different question:

**What conditions allow a direction of time to remain stable and distinguishable at all?**

The central hypothesis is that temporal irreversibility does not originate
from dynamics alone (e.g. entropy production),
but from asymmetries in what can close, persist, and remain admissible
across scales.

In this view, the arrow of time is treated as a boundary phenomenon:
a directional bias that appears when systems transition from reversible
descriptions to regimes where closure becomes necessary.

## Reversibility, Irreversibility, and Boundary Formation

At the level of fundamental physical laws, most known dynamics are time-reversible.
Classical mechanics, electromagnetism, and even quantum evolution preserve symmetry
under time reversal.

Yet at macroscopic scales, systems exhibit a clear temporal direction:
processes unfold, decay occurs, memories accumulate, and histories cannot be undone.

This apparent contradiction suggests that irreversibility does not emerge
from the laws themselves, but from the conditions under which descriptions
remain stable.

The transition from reversible to irreversible behavior is proposed here
to coincide with the emergence of closure constraints:
situations in which not all microstates remain admissible or reconstructible.

When closure becomes necessary—due to complexity, information loss, or scale—
temporal symmetry breaks, and a directional arrow becomes observable.

Irreversibility, in this sense, is not imposed by dynamics,
but selected by admissibility.
